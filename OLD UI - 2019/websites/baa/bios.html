    <h2> Matt Rudolph </h2>

    <h3>Team Member</h3>

    <p>
          Aspiring marine biologist, Matt Rudolph, has been watching whales since his youth. Equipped with a childhood’s worth of memories from the coast of North Yorkshire, Matt knew from birth that sea life was all he wanted to see in life. Matt is brimming with ocean related facts and is ready to prove it at a moments notice. By specializing in whales, Matt has “followed his life’s calling and never been happier.” After eight years of higher education exclusively tailored towards his favorite seafaring mammal, Matt has joined the Business Assessment Association to offer the financial world a skill set it never knew it needed.
