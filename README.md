This is the repository for my personal portfolio website! It was constructed from-the-ground-up using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript / JQuery for the frontend, as well as some small libraries (mainly LocalStorage) to emulate backend functions. Many of the assets of this website are also custom-made, such as the pixel art icons and my personal logo.

## External Assets Used
* Hamburgers by Jon Suh (for hamburger menu styles and animations)
* Devicon by Konpda (for tech icons)
* DepredationPixie (font) by unknown
* Free Pixel (font) by levelb
* PixelMix (font) by Andrew Tyler
* Century Gothic (font) by Monotype Imaging

## How to Run
Simply download the files and open them up in a text / HTML editor. I prefer Dreamweaver.
