				</audio>
				<p><b>Landward Ho!</b> (2017) is a composition for symphony orchestra which was one of my first attempts at writing film score-esque music. When writing this piece, I wanted to capture the exhilirating thrill of adventure, as if the listener is setting sail to embark on a journey to discover new lands and opportunities. The piece is also written like something of a short story: it starts off with the listener leaving port and starting their journey. However, a short way into the jounrey (~1:05), the listener becomes a little homesick, but continues their adventure regardless (~1:30). The journey then quiets down a little (~2:14), until the listener sights new land and heads to begin a new adventury (~2:41); hence, "Landward Ho!".</p>

				<h3>Alien Landscape</h3>
				<audio controls>
					<source src="files/music/aliensoundscape.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
				</audio>
				<p><b>Alien Landscape</b> (2018) is definitely a lot different than the other pieces on this page, in that it's not what would be considered a typical "song". This piece was written in one of my classes (<b>MUS 221H: Music Technologies</b>) as one of our projects, and is meant to give the feeling of a strage, foreign soundscape the listener is not used to. I chose to make my piece sound like an "alien jungle", with lots of digital audio effects and sounds (such as chirping birds, running water, ringing bells, etc.) to make the piece seem vaguely familiar, yet still "alien". Synthetic instruments are also used to help create tension throughout the piece.</p>

				<h3>Devoid</h3>

				</audio>
				<p><b>Devoid</b> (2015) is a pretty simple piece for piano written in G minor (my favorite key!). Technically, this piece was written for a scrapped game called <b>Galaxy Wars</b> as somber background music, but I ended up liking it so much that I changed it to a standalone concert piece. When writing the piece, I tried to give the title two separate meanings. First, I wanted it to feel as the title implies: devoid and empty. Particularly in the beginning and end, I used lots of long pauses between note groups to make the song cold and contemplative. However, this is sort of inverted in the middle for the second meaning of the piece: removing the void (de-voiding, if you will). The climax of the piece has lots of fast notes and loud chords, which, in conjunction with a more heroic sound, help fill the emptiness of the void.</p>

				<p><b>Galaxy Wars - Main Theme</b> (2017) is, as the title implies, the main theme for a scrapped video game I was working on called <b>Galaxy Wars</b>. When working on video games, I have a nasty habit of wanting to write the music before completing the framework of the game. This piece is a prime example of that: it was meant to play on the title screen and a few other areas of the game, but it was written before any place it could be used was created. Maybe one day I'll keep working on the game and be able to use this theme?</p>

				</audio>
				<p><b>Empty Town</b> (2015) is a song that would play in an abandoned town or building level in a video game. This song is pretty similar to <b>Devoid</b> above, as it is also in G minor, uses similar motifs, and is meant to convey emptiness. How this song differs is in its compositional style. When writing the piece, I wanted to experiment with odd, changing time signatures (switching between 3/4, 4/4, and 5/4, mainly) and a mix of traditional / synthetic instruments.</p>

				<h3>Mines</h3>

					<source src="files/music/mines.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
				</audio>
				<p><b>Mines</b> (2014) is a song that would play in a mine level of a video game. To properly capture the industrious feel of mines, I wanted this song to very metallic and percussive. Thus, the only instruments used in this song are percussion (namely bass + snare drums, timpani, vibraphone, marimba, xylophone, chimes, glockenspiel, cymbals, and anvil). The piece is also meant to be very rhythmic, including the constant "clang-clang" motif in the anvil and use of offbeats in the beginning and middle sections.</p>

					<source src="files/music/ashcastle.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
				</audio>
				<p><b>Final Castle</b> is the theme for a final level of a game I've been working on slowly throughout the years. This song is meant to sound very regal and epic, with the heavy use of powerful brass, soaring strings, and echoing choir. I wanted the player to feel determined and empowered to beat the game while listening to this, but also maybe a little melancholy as well (as evidenced by the slower section of the song). I'm not entirely satisfied with the loop in this song, so I'll probably end up re-arranging it and re-orchestrating it at some point.</p>

				</audio>
				<p><b>Elevator Music #1</b> (2015) was my first attempt at writing "elevator music" for an elevator in a video game. To me, the most characteristic aspect of elevator music is the use of jazz instruments (saxophone, trombone, etc.) and Latin percussion, particularly claves. Thus, when writing this song, I focused on using those instruments heavily (which can be heard with the constant clave clicks and saxophone / trombone melodies). This song also features simple chords and melodies to help add to the "snacky" feel of elevator music.</p>

				<p><b>Woods</b> (2014) is a song that would play in a forest level of a video game. Originally, I wrote this piece as part of a short orchestral suite, but ended up liking this particular chunk in a video game context more. After all, this piece is a simple, plucky piece that uses a rhythmic motif (in the bassoons, pizzicato strings, and woodblock) to give the feel of a light stroll through the woods. However, this piece still needs to be re-worked so it can loop; the preview shown here was directly taken from the incomplete suite.</p>
