The goal of this course was to learn about the Agile Software Development process by build a web application that people could conceivably use.<br><br>When first visiting the site, users can see a list of all apps available on Appalogue. However, to interact with some of Appalogue's features, users must first create an account using an email address. Once logged in, users have the ability to leave one review per app by viewing the app's info and leaving a review (a star rating and a comment). If the review is offensive or of poor quality, a moderator can remove the review. When logged in, users can also submit app requests to be added to Appalogue. These requests can then be approved or denied by an admin. If approved, the app is then shown to all users on the Appalogue home screen. Users may also search for apps in two ways: using the search bar to search by app name, or using advanced search (in the bottom navigation area) to search by other fields, like developer or price. Lastly, there is a Help / FAQ page in the bottom navbar, if the user is confused or needs additional help.<br><br>For this project, I was in charge of the user interface design, app view / creation / deletion, user login, user permissions (admin, moderator, etc.), and star reviews. The UI was created from scratch using HTML / CSS, while features like user login and star ratings were handled by Ruby gems (Devise and jQuery.raty, a jQuery plugin).</p>

The focus of this class was on designing and creating effective web interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for various devices; this project was for mobile phones. While designing the website, I incorporated many mobile-friendly design elements, including a button to immediately return to the top of a scrolled page and placing the navbar at the bottom of the screen.<br><br>For theis assignment, the website's content was supposed to be about creating a business for "an industry which needed disrupting". Thus, I chose to create a website for a educational VR company, which provided "serious games" (educational and training games) to companies and schools.</p>

This project is no exception; for this project, we first used Bootstrap to create a web interface. Then, we used jQuery and PHP to design a RESTful API to handle various button inputs and requests. A user can log into the web application, then is able to select items that they've consumed in the past and add them to the tracker. The tracker support total counts for each food item, as well as history of the last 30 items.<br><br>To log in and view the page, use the username "test" and password "test".</p>

This class was a continuation of IMS 222, diving deeper into techniques for creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interfaces for websites.This assignment revolved around creating a business website that could conceivably be used in the professional world. One of our group members suggested we go over-the-top and just make the whole thing full of generic business buzzwords, and the rest is history.<br><br>Each group member was in charge of creating a webpage for the site - my page is the "Estimates" page, which uses four number inputs to generate a random number (and a "Kaching!" sound). I also was in charge of assembling the overall website, meaning that I had to combine each person's pages into a coherent website.</p>

This class was a continuation of CSE 287 (now 386), and discussed the techniques and algorithms behind 3D graphics generation in real-time engines, such as those used in games. The first part of the class revolved around learning how OpenGL worked and how to effectively use it in graphics applications (such as buffers, shaders, uniform blocks, etc.), while the second half used that information to construct a basic game engine. Included in this game engine were texture mapping, model loading (using ASSIMP), cameras, game objects, components, scene graphs and scene graph transformation, sound (using FMOD), physics (using Bullet), and Quaternions.<br><br>Our final for this class was using the game engine we created to create a rudimentary game.

This course was more concerned with the implementations instead of the execution of said features; thus, the program runs on the CPU instead of the GPU and is slower than usual.<br><br><b>Controls:</b><br>• <b>B</b>: Toggle fullscreen<br>• <b>Esc</b>: Quit application<br>• <b>1-4</b>: Set Recursion Depth<br>• <b>A</b>: Toggle ambient light<br>• <b>D</b>: Toggle directional light<br>• <b>P</b>: Toggle positional light<br>• <b>S</b>: Toggle spot light<br>• <b>F-H</b>: Change camera position<br>• <b>Z</b>: Toggle antialiasing<br></p>

Users first open up the app, then move to the center of the room. Once there, the player has to hunt for megaphones placed in various locations around the room.
